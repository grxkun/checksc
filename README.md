# Smart Contract Checker (checksc)

The Smart Contract Checker (`checksc`) is a Node.js script that provides multiple capabilities for managing and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.

## Features

- **Access Smart Contract Code**: View the source code of the smart contract in question.
- **Review Connected Account Configuration**: Examine sections in the smart contract code dealing with connected accounts or external addresses.
- **Verify Access Control**: Check for specific functions or variables that are accessible only by certain accounts.
- **Check Permissions and Configuration**: Review configurations related to connected accounts, such as whitelists, blacklists, permissions, or specific roles assigned to certain accounts.
- **Audit Smart Contract**: Conduct a thorough audit of the smart contract for vulnerabilities, including misconfigurations related to connected accounts.
- **Interact with Smart Contract**: Invoke functions and retrieve information from the deployed smart contract.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/checksc.git
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    cd checksc
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Compile your smart contract using Truffle:

    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

2. Deploy your smart contract to an Ethereum network using Truffle migrations.

3. Update `checksc.js` with the correct path to your smart contract code and compiled JSON file containing the ABI.

4. Run the `checksc.js` script:

    ```bash
    node checksc.js
    ```

## Configuration

- Modify the `checksc.js` script to customize functionality or add additional features.
- Ensure you have the correct network settings configured in `checksc.js` for interacting with the Ethereum network.
